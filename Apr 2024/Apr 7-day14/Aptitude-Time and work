M did a piece of work in 5 days. That piece of work was done by N in 9 days. If M and N worked together, they got total wages of Rs 4200. Find the share of N.

A) 1500
B) 2000
C) 1000
D) 1200
E) None of these
Solution:
 M works for 5 days
 N works for 9 days 
therefore total work = 45 (LCM of 5 and 9)
M's one day work  45/5=9
N's one day work 45/9=5
therefore the ratio of wages is 9:5
            9x+5x=4200
            14x=4200
            x=4200/14
            x=300
therefore, the share of N's share is 5*300=1500
Option a is correct

A can do a piece of work in 9 days and B in 18 days. They begin together, but A goes away three days before the work is finished. The work lasts for
a) 6 Days
b) 8 Days
c) 12 Days
d) 10 Days
e) 3 Days
Solution:
                       1 day work
           A                1/9
           B                1/18
total work = lcm of 9 and 18 ====> 18 units
                                  efficiency
           A                1/9=====> 18/9====> 2 u/d
           B                1/18====> 18/18===> 1 u/d
  A leaves three days before so last three days B alone works ====> work completed by B alone= no of days * efficiency of B
                                                                  = 3*1=3 
   therefore remaining work = 18-3
                            = 15 units
A+B efficiency= 2+1= 3 u/d
No of days = No of units/ efficiency
           =15/3===> 5 days 
therefore total no of days = 5+3= 8 days
Option b is correct
