M did a piece of work in 5 days. That piece of work was done by N in 9 days. If M and N worked together, they got total wages of Rs 4200. Find the share of N.

A) 1500
B) 2000
C) 1000
D) 1200
E) None of these
Solution:
 M works for 5 days
 N works for 9 days 
therefore total work = 45 (LCM of 5 and 9)
M's one day work  45/5=9
N's one day work 45/9=5
therefore the ratio of wages is 9:5
            9x+5x=4200
            14x=4200
            x=4200/14
            x=300
therefore, the share of N's share is 5*300=1500
