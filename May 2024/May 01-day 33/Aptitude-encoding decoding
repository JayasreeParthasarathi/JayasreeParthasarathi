1. In a certain code language “CONSTRUCTION” is written as “EMPQVPWAVGQL”. What will be the code for “DESTRUCTION” in the same language?

a) FCURTSERKMP
b)EFTVSVDVJPO
c) FCURTSFSLOQ
d) None of the above

Solution:
          A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z
          1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14  15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
    From this code we can understand that, 
                even place letters are increased with 2
                odd place letters are decreased with 2
So ,  D+2=F
      E-2=C
      S+2=U
      T-2=R
      R+2=T
      U-2=S
      C+2=E
      T-2=R
      I+2=K
      O-2=M
      N+2=P
So Option a is correct

2. In a certain code language, “YEARLY” is written as “BVZIOB”. What will be the code for “ANNUAL” in the same language?

a) ZFMOMM
b) ZNNFZA
c) ZMMFZO
d) XCADGF
e) ZXAMMO

Solution:

              A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z
              Z  Y  X  W  V  U  T  S  R  Q  P  O  N  M  L  K  J  I  H  G  F  E  D  C  B  A
              1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14  15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
    From this code we can understand that, 
                            It shows the reverse ordered number that is 
                                          A=Z=26
                                          N=M=14
                                          N=M=14
                                          U=F=21    
                                          A=Z=26
                                          L=O=12

Option c is correct
