solution:
              A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z
              Z  Y  X  W  V  U  T  S  R  Q  P  O  N  M  L  K  J  I  H  G  F  E  D  C  B  A
              1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14  15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
From the above coding   L and A are same and the remaining letters are increased by 2
so the answer is  I+2=K
                  L
                  J+2=L
                  A
Option d is correct

              A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z
              Z  Y  X  W  V  U  T  S  R  Q  P  O  N  M  L  K  J  I  H  G  F  E  D  C  B  A
              1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14  15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
In this question the first letter is decreased by 1 and the remaining letters are interchanged with their adjacent letters.
so the answer is   p-1=o
                   at=ta
                   te=et
                   rn=nr
answer is otaetnr
Option c is correct
